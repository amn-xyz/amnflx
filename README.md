# 🌐 Personal Portfolio — Built with Next.js

Welcome to my personal portfolio project — a work in progress and a hands-on journey into the world of **Next.js**! This site is more than just a place to showcase my work; it's also a sandbox where I’m experimenting, learning, and growing as a developer.

## 🚀 About This Project

This project is built from the ground up using **Next.js**, React, and Tailwind CSS. It’s part of my learning journey into modern web development and static site generation (SSG). 

I'm using this opportunity to understand:
- Dynamic routing and API routes in Next.js
- Server-side rendering (SSR) vs static generation
- Tailwind CSS for rapid and responsive UI development
- Performance optimization and accessibility best practices
